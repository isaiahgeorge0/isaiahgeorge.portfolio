    <h2 data-aos="fade-up">More About Me</h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
      Born and raised in Ipswich, Suffolk, my journey has taken me across Europe and now to the heart of the American Southwest, Phoenix, Arizona. With every move, my vision has grown clearer: to build a career around creativity, personal freedom, and purpose.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
      I’ve always had a passion for fashion, photography, and digital expression. These passions led me into modeling and content creation, first as a creative outlet, now as a professional pursuit. Whether I'm on a fashion shoot or working on branded content, I approach every project with intent and energy.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
      What I love most about this work is the diversity: no two projects are the same. I get to collaborate with creatives from all walks of life and explore different aesthetics, from fitness to lifestyle to high fashion. The variety keeps me evolving.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
      I take pride in offering not just deliverables, but an experience. Every client interaction is an opportunity to bring value, push creative boundaries, and make something that stands out. This brand was built from scratch! Every page, every design, every photo, with time, discipline, and purpose.
    </p>

    <blockquote data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      “Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing.” — Pelé
    </blockquote>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
      If you're a brand, agency, or creative individual looking to collaborate, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s build something meaningful.
    </p>
